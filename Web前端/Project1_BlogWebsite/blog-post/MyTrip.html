                    <p>
                        I came to the United States in 2017. I have lived in Seattle for more than three years. I'm sharing some photos I took in the United States with you. I hope you can like it..

                    <h4>SEASON SPRING</h4>
                    <p>Skagit Valley Tulip Festival</p>
                    <p>
                    Historically, the tulip was a symbol of paradise on earth.  Come April in the Skagit Valley, we welcome you to our modern day paradise on earth where millions of tulips burst into bloom during The Skagit Valley Tulip Festival.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The Skagit Valley Tulip Festival is magic! The Magic Skagit Valley’s natural wonders also include shorelines, bays, islands, mountains, the Skagit River and one of the largest and most diverse agricultural communities west of the Cascade mountain range.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Skagit Valley Farmers invite visitors to take a scenic drive through the valley and experience the art of farming during the Skagit Valley Tulip Festival and throughout the year.  Did you know that agriculture is the No. 1 industry in Skagit County?   More tulip, iris, and daffodil bulbs are produced here than in any other county in the U.S.,  and local farmers produce about $261 million worth of 90 different crops, livestock, and dairy products on 93,000 acres of land. In addition to food and fiber products, agriculture in the Skagit Valley provides habitat for thousands of swans, snow geese, and dabbling ducks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Come see why the rest of the world agrees that Skagit Valley is an incredible destination!

                    Mount Rainier (pronounced: /reɪˈnɪər/), also known as Tahoma or Tacoma, is a large active stratovolcano in the Cascade mountain range located 59 miles (95 km) south-southeast of Seattle,[4] in Mount Rainier National Park. With a summit elevation of 14,411 ft (4,392 m),[5][6] it is the highest mountain in the U.S. state of Washington, and of the Cascade Range of the Pacific Northwest, the most topographically prominent mountain in the contiguous United States,[7] and the tallest in the Cascade Volcanic Arc.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Mt. Rainier is considered one of the most dangerous volcanoes in the world, and it is on the Decade Volcano list.[8] Because of its large amount of glacial ice, Mt. Rainier could produce massive lahars that could threaten the entire Puyallup River valley. "About 80,000 people and their homes are at risk in Mount Rainier’s lahar-hazard zones."[9]
